## Module Description
This module provides an introduction to intensive group project work in collaboration with an industrial or academic customer. Students work in groups of at least four people on a project typically based on an idea from an industrial partner, or from an academic research project looking to transfer technology to industry or build a demonstrator/proof of concept.

## Skills Developed

Being able to:

1. Apply mathematical and computer-based models for solving problems in engineering
2. Liaise with customers in order to determine the scope and requirements of your project, and the criteria for judging its success
3. Apply design processes and methodologies and adapt them in unfamiliar situations
4. Assess the limitations of particular cases when solving engineering problems, and reflect on and critically evaluate the effectiveness of your chosen approach
5. Apply engineering techniques, taking account of a range of commercial, legal, ethical, environmental, sustainability and industrial constraints
6. Generate innovative designs for products, systems, components or processes to fulfill new needs
7. Work as part of a team to manage your project, by planning and allocating tasks, and by coordinating your activities with those of your team mates
